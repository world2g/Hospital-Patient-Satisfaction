##  Key Insights Summary

This project reveals several important insights about patient satisfaction and hospital service performance:

###  1. Patient Satisfaction Is Generally High  
- The average patient satisfaction score is **79%**, indicating strong overall service quality.  
- Most patients, regardless of age or stay duration, report similar satisfaction levels.

###  2. Age, Stay Duration, and Service Type Do Not Strongly Influence Satisfaction  
- Satisfaction levels are consistent across age groups.  
- Longer or shorter hospital stays do not significantly impact satisfaction.  
- Service categories (Emergency, General Medicine, Surgery, ICU) show similar satisfaction patterns.  
➡️ **These factors are not primary drivers of dissatisfaction.**

###  3. About 24% of Patients Are Unsatisfied  
- Using a defined threshold of **70**, nearly **1 in 4 patients** fall into the unsatisfied group.  
- Patients aged around **77** appear most frequently in this group.

###  4. High Patient Satisfaction During Negative Staff Events  
- Surprisingly, patient satisfaction remains stable — even **high (83%) during a strike**.  
- Staff morale is lowest during the same period, indicating a disconnect between:  
  - Staff experience  
  - Patient perception  
➡️ This anomaly suggests deeper systemic or communication-related factors worth investigating.

###  5. Emergency Department Has the Highest Refusal Rates  
- Emergency services have a refusal rate of **up to 80%**.  
- This does **not** necessarily indicate poor performance — it reflects triage realities.  
- High refusal rates may still signal operational strain or capacity challenges.

###  6. General Medicine Has the Largest Bed Capacity  
- The department operates with **at least 74 beds**, significantly more than others.  
- This affects patient flow, admissions, and service load.

##  Overall Conclusion
While the hospital maintains **consistently positive patient satisfaction**, the analysis highlights areas for deeper investigation:

- The root causes behind the large unsatisfied segment (24%)  
- Why satisfaction remains high during staff morale crises  
- Operational implications of high refusal rates  
- Capacity balancing across departments  

These insights provide a foundation for improving both **patient experience** and **operational efficiency** through targeted interventions.
