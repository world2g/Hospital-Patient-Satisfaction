# Report on the Services Provided.

This report is a continuation of the [Patients' Summary Report](/Power_BI_Reports/Patients%20Summary.md). This report analyses the hospital’s services to understand how service-level performance—including bed capacity, refusals, staff morale, and events—relates to patient satisfaction.

The service dataset is utilised in this report. The dataset consists the week and month a particular service was provided, the service, available beds, patient requests, patients admitted, patients denied admission, patient satisfaction, staff morale and events happening in the hospital.

The data shows that the **General Medicine** department has the largest bed capacity, with at least **74** beds. 

## Hospital Events

Surprisingly, patient satisfaction peaks during strike periods (83%) despite staff morale being lowest. This may suggest that reduced service activity, increased attention to admitted patients, or sample size effects could play a role. Further investigation is required.

## Patient Refusal Rates

The **Emergency Department** has the highest refusal rate at 80%, likely due to triage guidelines rather than service failure. High refusal does not appear to correlate with lower satisfaction, indicating patients may understand the nature of emergency prioritization.
