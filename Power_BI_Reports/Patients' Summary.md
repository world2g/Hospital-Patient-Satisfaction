# Patients
We first start by understanding the satisfaction of the patients and factors that could influence it. The [Patient's dataset](), provided valuable insight about this.

![Patients' Overview]()

The average patient satisfaction for the duration the data was collected, was **79 %**. This value is satisfactory for the hospital establishment. 

## Key Factors Influencing the Scores.

The dataset ony includes patients that were admitted in the hospital and no outpatients. The factors that I have assessed to determine their influence on the patient satisfaction are:

 1. Services Provided to the patients
 2. Duration of the patients' stay
 3. Patients' age

### Services Provided to the Patients
According to the dataset, the services provided are:

- Emergency
- General Medicine
- Intensive Care Unit (ICU)
- Surgery

![Patients' Service Graph]()

The data shows that Patient satisfaction is generally similar across all the services provided in the hospital. This suggests that the services provided are not a direct area of weakness in the hospital.

### Patients' stay duration 
![Average Satisfaction AgainstStay ]()

The graph shows the satisfaction of the patients according to their stay length in the hospital. Again, the values are within the same range and close to the mean. The patients' stay is not a limiting factor to patient satisfaction.

### Patients' Age

![Patients Age Graph]()

Age is also not a limiting factor.


## Unsatisfied Patients
The visualisations above did not provide direct results. We therefore created a threshold to distinguish satisfied patients from the unsatisfied.
The threshold for determining satisfaction is **70**.

![Unsatisfied Patients]()

Using this new metric, we see that **24 %** of the patients were unsatisfied. 
The visual that is most noteworthy, might be of the number of unsatisfied patients classified according to age. Patients at the age of **77** were most unsatisfied.
